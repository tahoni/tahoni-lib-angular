## Instructions

**Development server**

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

**Code scaffolding**

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

**Build**

Run `ng build tahoni-lib` to build the project. The build artefacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

**Publish**

Run `npm publish` from the `dist/` directory to publish the project. Remember to add a .npmrc file and not to check it
in.

**Running unit tests**

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

**Running end-to-end tests**

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you first need to add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

**Further help**

To get more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or go check out
the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
